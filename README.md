Hello, Wanderer!

### `> whoami`

My name is Sergii, I am a self-taught software tester / developer from Ukraine 🇺🇦  
At work I'm most passionate about software quality 🔍 and automation ⚙️ I also enjoy uncovering and fixing nasty 🐞  
In my spare time I enjoy a variety of different things which are too numerous to list here.  

### `> for i in $📌; do; echo "$i"; done`

- 🦸‍♂️ By day I work [@CegalSYSCO](https://sysco.no), where I create all sorts of automation 🤖 using Tea Driven Development 🍵🔨, with my main focus areas being testing 🧪 and CI 💯
  - 👨‍💻 I also have been for the past 4 years and continue to-day wearing a bunch of development hats :shipit: [@Elhub](https://elhub.no), working with test automation, cloud, back-end development, CI/CD, and dev experience.
- 🦹‍♂️ By night I’m currently learning 🌱 [λ Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and functional programming.
  - 🌲 My "evergreen goals" are: learning and expanding my programming and leadership skills. I am always excited about new challenges, and I want to be ready for anything I might end up doing profesionally in the fugure. I love learning new stuff, so as Gandhi once said, *"Learn as if you were to live forever"* 📚
