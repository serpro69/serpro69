My name is Sergii, I am a self-taught software tester / developer from Ukraine 🇺🇦 living in Norway 🇳🇴  
At work I'm most passionate about software quality and automation 🦹‍♂️ I also enjoy uncovering and fixing nasty 🐞  
In my spare time I enjoy a variety of different things which are too numerous to list here.  
I like coffee ☕, but I like good tea 🍵 even more.

- 🤓 By day I'm a Senior Managing Consultant in [CegalSYSCO](www.sysco.no), focusing on testing (mostly test automation and test management) and CI.
- 👨‍💻 I also have been for the past 4 years and continue to-day wearing a bunch of development hats in [Elhub](https://elhub.no), working with test automation, cloud, back-end development, CI/CD, and dev experience. While most of our (Elhub's) code is "inner-source", we have some [OSS projects](https://github.com/orgs/elhub/repositories) on github as well, so check it out if you're interested.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and functional programming.
- 💬 Ask me about: software testing, automation, CI/CD, Ansible, team building, leadership, personal finance, personal productivity. Also feel free to shoot me a message if you'd like to chat about anything else.
