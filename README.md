My name is Sergii, I am a self-taught software tester / developer from Ukraine 🇺🇦 living in Norway 🇳🇴  
At work I'm most passionate about software quality 🔍 and automation ⚙️ I also enjoy uncovering and fixing nasty 🐞  
In my spare time I enjoy a variety of different things which are too numerous to list here.

- 🦸‍♂️ By day I'm a Senior Managing Consultant in [CegalSYSCO](www.sysco.no) where I create all sorts of automation 🤖 using Tea Driven Development 🍵🔨, with my main focus areas being testing 🧪 and CI 💯
  - 👨‍💻 I also have been for the past 4 years and continue to-day wearing a bunch of development hats :shipit: in [Elhub](https://elhub.no), working with test automation, cloud, back-end development, CI/CD, and dev experience. While most of our (Elhub's) code is "inner-source", we have some [OSS projects](https://github.com/orgs/elhub/repositories) on github as well, so check it out if you're interested.
- 🦹‍♂️ By night I’m currently learning 🌱 [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and functional programming.
  - 🌲 My "evergreen" goals are: learning and expanding my programming and leadership skills. I am always excited about new challenges, and I want to be ready for anything I might end up doing profesionally in the fugure. I love learning new stuff, so as Gandhi once said, *"Learn as if you were to live forever"* 📚
- 💬 Ask me about: software testing, automation, CI/CD, Ansible, team building, leadership, personal finance, personal productivity. Also feel free to shoot me a message if you'd like to chat about anything else, chances are - I'll be interested.

  - 🔏 Online privacy and personal data protection
  - :octocat: OSS
  - 📖 Free and open knowledge
